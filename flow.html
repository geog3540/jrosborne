		<p><strong>Interpretation of Flow Map</strong></p>
		<p class="card-text">The three variables displayed on this map come together in a very interesting way. Although not all the flows are displayed, due to cluttering reasons, the background choropleth map and nodes display very good supporting data to fill in the gaps left by the exclusion of many flows. The background choropleth map does a very good job of showing regions where people were leaving from and where they were going to. If I had to choose two cardinal directions of flow on this map, it would be from the east to the west and from the south to the north. Both of these trends are likely due to different reasons. I believe that the trend from the east to the west is likely due to the still young nation experiencing manifest destiny. During this period, the western states were relatively new compared to the more eastern states and had a sort of mystic. People were drawn to the west for its beautiful nature, cheap land claims, and freedom. This is displayed on the map with the northwestern states, as well as California, having the higher net flow ratios (displayed in the two shades of blue). The trend of people moving from the south (namely the southeast) to the north displays the aftereffects of the civil war. With slavery finally being abolished in the war-torn south, the economy began to struggle, and the infrastructure was severely damaged without the cheap (and inhumane) workforce to fix it. This is likely the cause for the very low net flow ratios we see in the southeastern states. The Midwest is a very interesting region on this map, as it has the highest number of flowlines going throughout it. It is hard to precisely determine exactly what was causing the massive migrations between these states, but it is reasonable to assume that it is due to families hearing about opportunities in other states and taking their chances. Fast transportation, like cars, were not widespread at this time so it makes sense that these families did not move very far. A couple of interesting outliers are present in the net flow data, being Iowa and Oklahoma. Iowa, a union state, was likely unaffected by the abolishment of slavery yet still sees a very low net flow. This may be due to the dominance of agriculture in the state, which was likely well established by this time. People looking for jobs were probably not attracted to the very rural nature of Iowa, as owning a farm required a decent amount of starting capital as well as land. This lack of non-agricultural jobs likely led people to leave the state while also keeping people out. To understand why Oklahoma is an island of high net flow, I researched what was happening there at this time and found some interesting information. Oklahoma in the late 1800s and early 1900s hosted many industries that just about any man could work for. These industries ranged from mining to railroad work and attracted many Mexican migrants, who likely came from Texas (where we see the largest flowline on the map coming to Oklahoma from). This enriched the culture of Oklahoma, drawing many people in (OKhistory, n.d.). Although the state of California has the largest net flow out of all the states, it only has 3 small flowlines going to it on my map. This is due to the filtering of smaller flowlines to reduce cluttering, telling me that most migrations to California happened in small groups of people. This makes a lot of sense due to the distance from the more populated east. This is likely congruent with all other western states.
